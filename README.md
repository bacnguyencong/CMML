# CMML - Clustered Multi-Metric Learning
An efficient method for clustered multi-metric learning


CMML contains the implementation of Clustered Multi-Metric Learning. 
For any question, please contact Bac Nguyen (Bac.NguyenCong@ugent.be).

### Prerequisites
This has been tested using MATLAB 2010A and later on Windows and Linux (Mac should be fine).

### Installation
Download the folder "CMML" into the directory of your choice. Then within MATLAB go to file >> Set path... and add the directory containing "CMML" to the list (if it isn't already). That's it.

### USAGE

Please run (inside the matlab console)
```matlab
demo_1
demo_2
```
